state tree for base cardinal directions.
state tree for base dimentions of shapes (1d) 1 color.
state machine for detecting edge.
at least 1 nearby(1 unit) square is different from current square.
if tracker 1 can visit all shape squares without finding tracker 2 while tracker 2 doesn't move.
tracker 1 is using a different shape than tracker 2.
window slide for grouping substates having common superstate.
read sequence, group, make new states and state graph from input sequence.
retry matching partially constructed graph with the next input.
if the first nodeName matches the next item in input keep matching till entire partial graph matches the input.
if first matches but doesn't get all the way through the graph it's a new path(starts with first match and ends at first mismatch) added onto the end.
